[]means what user needs to define by thereself, i.e names and file path.
Each single input must have a \n when finished, i.e  create layer first\n.

create layer [UserSpecifiedName] #must be done before everything else.
delete layer [LayerName] #delete the specified layer in model, result in the layer created after increment one level.

current [LayerName] #set the layer with specified name topmost visible.

save [FilePath.format] #save the image in current layer with specified file path and formate.
saveAll #Save to the default file res/MultiLayerPackage with a Layers.txt and image name the same as layer name and jpg as default.  The txt file is in the sequence of layer's visibility.

load [ImageFilePath] #load an image in the file path, an image must load before giving operations below.
loadAll [FilePathForTXT]#load from the default package with what output from saveAll or in a same format as what saveAll is, In this assignment, we by default believe images are under same location as TXT

blur #operate blur on the image
sharpening ##operate  sharpening on the image
sepia ##operate  sepia on the image
greyscale ##operate  greyscale on the image

The Above four operation is in a single line with nothing else

invisible [LayerName] #Make the layer with user defined name visible or invisible, by default, the topmost layer is now set to be first visible layer below this one(in the order of "create").
visible [LayerName]  # by default, the called layer is set to topmost

For example, rhere are two layers first and second. And we want to invisible the first layer and blur the second:
create layer first
create layer second
(load images for first and second layer.)
current first
invisible first
current second
blur
